BikeShop Group project 
Step 1 of using github is downloading git.
  https://git-scm.com/downloads
  - Git allows us to create branches, seperate instances of a file that are connected to the orginal
  - This will allow us to work on the same project while adding our own code to it without affecting the orginal.
